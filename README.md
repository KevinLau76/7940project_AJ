NOTICE:

This chatbot can already run on the cloud platform. You should input "/start" to begin the pad application, or simply ask a question about cookary or nutrition analysis. But as for the network reason,
this command would take about 2 minutes to respond with a main menu (average time under several tries). The following operations show a good
response performance. But when it comes to getting response from HKBU ChatGPT, the time cost maybe longer (around 5 min at most). This may caused by
the API itself. Updating token helps nothing. You should wait for a while when testing it if the wait time is long. Take care.
